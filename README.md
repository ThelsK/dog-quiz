#MOTh's Dog Quiz
##A project by Thels, Olga and Mirte at Codaisseur Academy.
This single-page web application offers a fun way for users to learn about dog breeds. It contains an overview of all the different dog breeds, with a page of random pictures for each breed. 

When the user is ready to put their knowledge to the test, there are three different quiz games to explore. They start easy and increase in difficulty as they progress. In the first game, the user is presented with a picture of a dog, and they have to click the correct breed name (or use the number keys on their keyboard). In the second game, they have to identify which dog picture belongs to a certain breed. The third combines the first two. Whenever th user has a streak of five correct answers, the game progresses to the next level.
